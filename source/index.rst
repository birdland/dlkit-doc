Welcome to the DLKit documentation!
===================================

This documentation for the Digital Learning Toolkit (DLKit) is still under development.
It currently covers only a small handful of the 160 service packages and 9,000 educational 
service APIs that have been defined to date.

The DLKit codebase is largely auto-generated from the Open Service Interface Definitions (OSIDs), 
a very large, complete and growing suite of interface contract specifications that describe the 
integration points among the core services and components that make up modern educational systems.

The complete OSID specification can be found at http://osid.org/specifications.

If you are interested in the DLKit Python libraries documented here, please contact merriman@mit.edu
