Welcome to the DLKit documentation!
===================================

This documentation for the Digital Learning Toolkit (DLKit), like the toolkit itself,
is still under development. It currently covers only a small handful of the 160 service packages 
and 9,000 educational service APIs that have been defined by MIT's Office of Digital Learning and
its collaborators to date.

The DLKit codebase is largely auto-generated from the Open Service Interface Definitions (OSIDs), 
an extensive and growing suite of interface contract specifications that describe the 
integration points among the core services and components that make up modern educational systems.

Note that this documentation is intended for API consumers. However, at the heart of DLKit is an
integration layer that is even more closely aligned with the OSID specifications.  This has been
designed to allow third parties to extend the library with alternative or additional implementations 
of any of the defined services for the purposes of service integration, technology migration, 
service adaptation, etc. Documentation written for service implementers and system integrators,
including implementation notes and compliance information, will be provided elsewhere.

The complete OSID specification can be found at http://osid.org/specifications.
